# Microsoft Tree Array

This project was part of a Microsoft technical interview for the role of Senior Software Engineer

/**
 * Given a zero-indexed array of size N, where each value a[i] is a parent node of i
 * write a program to generate the tree structure from this array.
 * 
 * e.g arr = [3, 3, 3, -1, 6, 1, 5, 2]
 * 
 * describes this tree
 * 
 *                  3
 *               /  |  \
 *              0   1   2
 *                  |    \
 *                  5      7
 *                  |
 *                  6
 *                  |
